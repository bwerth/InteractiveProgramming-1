<p>Music has been around for a very long time, and, like many things, it has continuously evolved.  This opens up many different genres, styles, and structures.  Historically, these musical works were created by compositional masters â€“ people with a talent for musical understanding and creativity.  Recently, there has been a growing interest in the use of computers to compose musical works.  This field of algorithmic music composition is huge with applications ranging from attempting to compose masterpiece works in the style of a particular composer to allowing music to be composed/generated real-time for DJ settings.</p>

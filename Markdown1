Agenda
Brief overview of the current and anticipated program functionality (5 min.)
Discussion of program functionality and current interface design (20 min.)

Background and Context
The final product will be a program that takes a genre of music and a duration of time as input and outputs a song of the chosen genre that is the given length.
The song will be generated using a modified markov chain that analyzes a data set of songs of the chosen genre. 
The GUI for the program will be produced using Kivy. 

Key Questions:
What genres of music would you want to be able to choose from?
Is there any related functionality that you would want this program to have?

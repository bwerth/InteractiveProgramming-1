Technical Review 1 Reflection

	This technical review helped us refine our process for making essential decisions going forward. Coming into this review, we had a number of broad questions regarding what functionality and interface our project would take. We did not have a lot of focus to what we wanted to do or how we wanted to do it. In response to the major questions we posed at the technical review, it was suggested that we refine by defining our target audience. This seems obvious now, but it was a fundamental methodology that we completely missed prior to the technical review. We plan to use this methodology throughout the project to make decisions regarding functionality of the program and especially to refine the concept and functionality of the program. In addition, we entered the technical review with a general idea of a possible GUI framework to use in the development of the program. During the review we received confirmation that the GUI framework we were considering, Kivy, could probably work with a reminder to ensure we could do everything necessary with it. This feedback was useful because neither of us has had much experience with GUIs before this project. Based on this, we will explore Kivy more with a mind for the desired program interface.
	The technical review went better than we thought it would for us, but there are things we could have done to improve the presentation organization. In creating the powerpoint, we tried to provide just the necessary amount of context, but in our presentation we explained things more than necessary which took time away that could have been spent elsewhere. Despite this, we got detailed feedback that did a lot to help us figure out how to make the necessary refinements. We are happy we received more methodology related feedback. In the future, we will likely do a similar technical review, but we will pay more attention to context and flow of the presentation.

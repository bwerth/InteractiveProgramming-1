                                                        Technical Review 2 Reflection

Although we did not have many questions at this point, the ones we did have were answered in this technical review. Coming into this technical review, our main focus was implementation. We had a good idea of what we were doing and how we wanted to get that done. The technical review was a way to refine our future goals based on what potential users would want from the program. A lot of good ideas were mentioned for both questions and we plan to take this input into consideration, but at this point the main focus remains getting an mvp to work. We plan to revisit this technical review once we have an mvp working and use it to help us refine the extensions we want to pursue. This input was useful, but not many new questions were generated because of the distance between where we are currently and where this feedback will be useful. 
During this technical review, everything went as planned for the most part. Our two questions were answered effectively and we have a lot to consider in the future when we begin planning extensions. In terms of framing, we tried to be as concise with providing background information as possible while still giving our peers the information they needed to be helpful. The audience did not seem to have too many clarifying questions during the technical review, so we believe a reasonable amount of context was given. We also followed the agenda closely. We only spent a couple minutes on context before using the rest of the time to have a discussion around our questions. The only way this technical review could have been better would be if we had better questions to ask our peers. We will use what we have learned and we learned what we expected to learn, but we feel as though we should have somehow found better questions to ask.
